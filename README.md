# RPG Tutorial
 A tutorial for an RPG game I have in the making.
 
 The tutorial starts you out with some dialogue that you can progress through by following the instructions that appear on-screen.
 Afterwards, you'll be entered into a sort of battle phase, where you fight against an enemy.
 
 Whether you win or lose, at the end you'll be prompted about repeating the tutorial from the beginning or not.
